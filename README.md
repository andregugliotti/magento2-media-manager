# Media Manager for Magento 2

This README was included in the initial commit and so it displays the dummy content.


## How to use this repository

If this repository contains a module or microservice, you can create a section like this, explaining how to use the
project and the steps that the user must follow to have the most things working.

This section should be as precise as the users must know to install and configure everything without going deep into 
the code. At the same time, this is not the project manual, which means that if a long sequence of steps must be
followed to have this project working, you should invest time to write and distribute a proper manual.


### First topic on this section

Where you can explain to the user how to download the code using Composer, for example:

`composer require "rockerchain/this-module"`


### Second topic on this section

Go on with the explanations. Remember that the text must be clear and don't forget that users have different OS, like
 Windows and Mac. Use the different formats to **highlight the important points** and make a clear separation of text
 and folders / commands. For example:

`- local.xml:/var/www/htdocs/etc/local.xml`


## Accessing the backend

This is the example for a second section, explaining how to access the backend. Navigate to:

`https://project.docker.local/backend`

username: `admin`

password: `a123456`


## Adding an image

You can add images to this README, via an external URL or a link to a project folder. Create a `readme-images` folder
on the project root and link the images here as below:
